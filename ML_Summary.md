# ML Summary of reading and lectures

## Lecture 1 What is machine learning?
- definition
    - use historical experience and data
    - make the process scalable
    - describe, predict, or strategize
- challenges -> find the best model that is **simple** and **generalize well to new data**
    1. collect data -----> data must be representative
    2. extract features -> developing representations of data to enable learning -> features can be extracted to learn
    3. fit model --------> model must be generalize well to new data -> simplest model that achieves the goal
- fitting problems
    - overfitting
        - try to satisfy all training data
        - against generalization
    - underfitting
        - not represent enough data
        - against fit well
